# Room_Booking_Spring_Boot_MongoDB_CRUD

- This is my first application made with Spring Boot and MongoDB.
- The application is made a little bit in a hurry thats why the implementation is childish. 
- I will make some modifications and updates such that the implementation will be more beautiful.
- I used 3 methods for the query part: using the repository, using mongoTemplate and mongoOperations.
- I never used Postman before, so I don't know if my approach is a good a bad one.
